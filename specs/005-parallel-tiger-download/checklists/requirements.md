# Specification Quality Checklist: Parallel TIGER/Line Data Download

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Concurrency cap of 5 is specified as an assumption; implementation can tune based on observed Census Bureau behavior.
- Bash 3.2 compatibility (macOS) is called out in Assumptions — implementation must not require `wait -n`.
- Rate-limit handling (FR-003) is addressed by both a concurrency cap (FR-002) and retry-on-429 behavior.
